# ShoppingListAPI 🛒

Welcome to **ShoppingListAPI**, your smart companion for organized and stress-free shopping. This project is designed to transform the way you manage your household needs, moving from messy notes to a streamlined, automated system.

## 🌟 What is it?
ShoppingListAPI is a smart management tool that allows you to create and manage various types of shopping lists—whether it's groceries, clothing, electronics, or anything else you need. 

Instead of trying to remember what's missing right before you head out, this app lets you track your inventory in real-time.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Versatile Lists:** Categorize your needs by type (Food, Fashion, Household, etc.).
* **Inventory Tracking:** Mark items as "out of stock" the moment they run out.
* **Weekly Smart Reminders:** No more forgotten items! Based on the data you input throughout the week, the app compiles a complete summary and sends you a reminder of exactly what you need to buy.
* **Quantity Management:** Keep track of not just *what* you need, but *how much* of it.

## 🛠 How it Works
1. **Create:** Set up your custom lists.
2. **Track:** Whenever an item is finished, simply update its status in the app.
3. **Receive:** Once a week, get a consolidated shopping list tailored to your actual needs.
